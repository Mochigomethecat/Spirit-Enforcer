1.  Demo Goals: A game with most of its MVP (minimum viable product) inspired by the Megaman Zero/Zx series. The first actual demo should have the capability of
	Walking, Crouching, Crawling, Jumping, Falling, Death, Wall-sliding, An attack of some sort, transition from a Dash to a Run or Crawl, transition from a Run to a Slide.
	a transition from a Slide to a Crouch, Climbing, Hanging, 1 test dummy, and opening a test menu. 
	
1a. Type: Action RPG Platformer
1b. Name: Spirit Enforcer
1c. Description: 
 
2.  Concepts: Mechanics behind everything
	  Global: Everything must follow these rules:
		Same Hp system (everyone can be hit)
		Same Physical attack system (anyone can hit)
		Same Physical Defense system (everyone can defend)
		Everything follows the Elemental Weakness Cycle
		Everything follows Attack property Attributes
		
		Health points(HP): Vitality of character. Every time damage is dealt, half the damage dealt is bleed damage. 
		Bleed - this regenerates overtime if not hit 
		(ex: = HP | - Bleed | _ no HP. 
		8 HP ========, take 4 damage, 4 HP ====--__, 5 HP =====-__, 6 HP ======__)
	
		Spiritual Power(SP): Energy used to perform Charge Attacks. Unless hit by a Piercing attack, all damage is dealt to SP before HP.
		Stamina Level (SL): When SP is empty, SL is used for Charge Attacks at double cost. SL regenerates and is ignored when taking damage unless specified.
		Any charged attacks made with SP deal 2x damage.
		

2a. Stats: Base characteristics such as attack power.
	--core
		Level      : Character level (multiplier is from level 1 [0.1] to 100[10], this means every level is an extra 0.1 to the multiplier in a formula). var levelActual.
		Health     : Life points. 2 variables, HpMax and HpNow.
		Spirit     : Energy points. 2 variables, SpiritMax and SpiritNow.
		Stamina    : Secondary energy points. 2 variables, StaminaMax and StaminaNow.
	--battle
		Attack     : The core value determining just how much damage will be dealt per hit. This variable can increase based on weapons.
		Defense    : A core value which will determine how much damage you take once Spirit is gone. This variable can increase based on armor.
		SPAttack   : Spiritual attack. This is only used when SpiritNow is > 0. Spirit moves that use more than you have cant be used. Stamina takes over when this runs out.
		SPDefense  : Spiritual defense. This is only used when SpiritNow is > 0. No matter how much damage the attack deals, if you have this, you take 0 damage. 
	--modifier (these have Deviation applied to them in a stat formula. Deviation is explained in Stat formulas)
		Strength   : A modifier value determining life and stamina.
		Vitality   : A modifier value determining life and spirit.
		Endurance  : A modifier value determining Stamina.
	--hidden
		Speed      : Base speed value. base value is preset and may differ by small amounts like 2-5% from the norm.
		Experience : Points for level ups
		Regenerate : Rate at which bleed and stamina refill. These will both share a variable unless proven to be a bad idea.
	--base
		//these values are all labeled as (base/4) below in the formulas and accordingly and are all constants for each player character only
		baseHealth
		baseSpirit
		baseStamina
		baseAttack
		baseDefense
		baseSpAttack
		baseSpDefense
	--enemy
	
	
2b. Stat formulas:  How each stats base affects each other (all values will be floored). 
					A deviation value is out of a max of 5, a multiplier that is applied to all modifier stats; some positive and some negative.
					Theres a deviation for all modifiers and player battle stats. Ex: 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 5;
					This means that in order from 1 to 10, these multipliers will make some characters stronger or weaker despite having a similar base stat total.
					Just note that these values will be more balanced and less extreme and are still subject to change. 
					Originally, only 5 deviant values were intended for more subtle changes.
	----players		// _ means through
	LevelDisplay  = (LevelActual * 10);
	Health        = (base/4) + (Vitality  * DevVit)     +     (Strength * DevStr) * (DevHp)     * LevelActual;
	Spirit        = (base/4) +      (HpMax / 2)         +     (Vitality * DevVit) * (DevSp)     * LevelActual;	
	Stamina       = (base/4) + (Endurance * DevEnd)     +     (Strength * DevStr) * (DevSt)     * LevelActual;
	DamageAttack  = (base/4) +  (Attack   * DevAtt)     + rand((levelDisplay/2) _ levelDisplay) * LevelActual * (determined by weapon attribute) ;
	DamageDefense = (base/4) +  (Defense  * DevDef)     + rand((levelDisplay/2) _ levelDisplay) * LevelActual * (determined by element);
	SpiritAttack  = (base/4) +  (SPAttack * DevSAtt)    + rand((levelDisplay/2) _ levelDisplay) * LevelActual * 2 * (determined by weapon attribute);
	SpiritDefense = (base/4) + (SPDefense * DevSDef)    + rand((levelDisplay/2) _ levelDisplay) * LevelActual * (determined by element);
	Dash          = Speed * 2.25; //dash multiplier, subject to change into vector formula later.

3. 	Mechanics

3a. Move Types: Class of Move
	Basic  - Simple moves and varies with character. Uses no SP.
	Charge - Moves that require SP or SL to perform.
	Spirit - Special ability specific to a character. Requirements Vary.
	Shield - Moves that reduce or negate damage. Requirements Vary.

3b. Attack Attributes: Secondary effects
	Piercing  - If target has spiritual power left, damage is multiplied by 0.5 and hits HP and SP.
	 (ex: HP 8(0 bleed) SP 8 SL 8) (HP 8(0 bleed) SP 0 SL 8) - Attack deals 4 damage. 
	 (    HP 6(1 bleed) SP 6 SL 8) (HP 4(2 bleed) SP 0 SL 8)
	 
	Break     - Deals double damage to SP. If SP is empty, normal damage is dealt to HP and Stamina
	 (ex: HP 8(0 bleed) SP 8 SL 8)  (HP 8(0 bleed) SP 0 SL 8) - assume attacks do 4 damage.
	 (    HP 8(0 bleed) SP 0 SL 8)  (HP 4(2 bleed) SP 0 SL 4)
	
	Cut       - Does not cause Bleed damage	(as backwards as this sounds, it means it leaves no chance to recover hp over time)
	 (ex: HP 8 SP 8 SL 8) (HP 8 SP 0 SL 8) - assume 4 damage
	 (    HP 8 SP 4 SL 8) (HP 4 SP 0 SL 8)
	
	Stacked   - If you have 2 of the same effect active,
	
	Normal    - Most basic attacks without a core element fall under this. Just damage and no special effects.
	Null      - Neutrally affected by elements as a character element and ignores damage reduction as an attack element. (Just another name for normal)
	Divine    - Ignores Invincibility.
	Water     - 0.5x SL Regeneration, stamina takes longer to regenerate. Subject to change, only hinders player.
	Fire      - 1.5x Damage to SP, takes damage and applies it to sp at 50% more.
	Wind      - 0.5x Bleed Damage, ex: with 8 hp, take 4 and get 2 bleed, wind makes it 1 bleed instead.
	Lightning - Ignores most Shields, enemy shields wont defend against this element, but its usually the lowest damage per hit.
	Ice       - Pierce effect
	Metal     - Break effect
	Plasma    - Cut effect	
	
3c. Elemental Cycle: Core Elements only - 1.5x damage if element is stronger / 0.5x damage if element is weaker
				 Sub  Elements only - Native Attack Attribute
	Core Element - Water, Fire, Lightning, Wind
	Sub  Element - Ice, Metal, Plasma
	Special      - Divine, Null
	Basic        - Normal
	
	Overdrive (OD): Powers up character overall until you turn it off, run out of SP, or get hit. Uses 1 SP per second. (2 perks, a weakness)
	Name      - Attack Multiplier      OD: Effect
	Null      - No Damage Multiplier.  OD: Can be used with SL; 1.2x damage and Half Charge moves replace uncharged Basic moves. You take no Bleed damage.
	Divine    - Always Wins.           OD: Unlimited use; Half Charge moves replace uncharged Basic moves. SP won't protect you and you stop moving while attacking on ground.
	Water     - Beats Fire             OD: Adds Water     to Basic attacks; Only take Bleed damage. Bleed damage doesn't regenerate while OD is active.
	Fire      - Beats Wind             OD: Adds Fire      to Basic attacks; 2x damage to Charge attacks. Restricted mobility.
	Wind      - Beats Lightning        OD: Adds Wind      to Basic attacks; Ignores Invincibility. 2x Damage taken.
	Lightning - Beats Water            OD: Adds Lightning to Basic attacks; Stick to walls and Fast Charge. No Invincibility.
	Ice       - Beats Plasma           OD: Adds Ice       to Basic attacks; 2x Damage with Pierce. 2x Damage taken from Break. 
	Metal     - Beats Ice              OD: Adds Metal     to Basic attacks; 0.5x Damage taken from non-Cut attacks. 2x Damage taken from Cut
	Plasma    - Beats Metal            OD: Adds Plasma    to Basic attacks; Ignores Shields. 2x Damage taken from Pierce
	
3d. Invincibility Mechanics:
	When hit, you gain invincibility frames for about 3 seconds. (When in free-roam mode, only the player and NPC characters get this. In Mission mode, Boss Level Enemies gain this benefit)
		Combo Value (CV): Each Attack has a Combo Value. When a hit is landed, Invincibility on the recipient is triggered and the CV is stored until it ends.
		CV defaults to 0, so when at 0, any attack can land. 
		CV 1 is special as any attack with CV 1 can combo with another CV 1 attack despite invincibility.
		CV 2+ is where each attack differs. If you hit with a move that has CV 2, you must either wait out the invincibility time, 
			or hit with a move with a CV of 3 or more.
		As long as the CV is higher than the the CV stored in invincibility from being hit, you can hit through it.

3e. Weapon Type/Descriptions: (1 Main weapon and 1 Sub weapon can be equipped. Size limit is 3 Slots) (level 1 charge is half, 2 is full. 3 is max)
							  Weapons all can be charged. The amount they charge, if at all, depends on the remaining slots. 2 slot weapons cannot be paired
							  with each other.
